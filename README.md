Company Introduction
       We design and develop a web-based application to manage airline service called “Phoenix Airline PVT”. This is an airline with a small online flight booking system       and lots of other processes, such as user management, flight management, and ticket management are done by manually. Because of Covid-19 situation they cannot do         those tasks by manually. So they required a website for that.
There are three types of users in our system.
    1.	User/Client
    2.	Staff-1
    3.	Staff-2
    4.	Admin
